"Each storage element defined in :file:`storage.config` is divided in to "
":term:`stripes`. The assignment table maps from an object URL to a "
"specific stripe. The table is initialized based on a pseudo-random "
"process which is seeded by hashing a string for each stripe. This string "
"is composed of a base string, an offset (the start of the stripe on the "
"storage element), and the length of the stripe. By default the path for "
"the storage is used as the base string. This ensures that each stripe has"
" a unique string for the assignment hash. This does make the assignment "
"table very sensitive to the path for the storage elements and changing "
"even one can have a cascading effect which will effectively clear most of"
" the cache. This can be problem when drives fail and a system reboot "
"causes the path names to change."

"the :ref:`assignment-table` the path used for the disk can effect the "
"cache if it changes. This can be ameloriated in some cases by using one "
"of the alternate paths in via ``/dev/disk``. Note that if the ``by-id`` "
"or ``by-path`` style is used, replacing a failed drive will cause that "
"path to change because the new drive will have a different physical ID or"
