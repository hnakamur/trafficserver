"The :file:`volume.config` file enables you to manage your cache space "
"more efficiently and restrict disk usage by creating cache volumes of "
"different sizes for specific protocols. You can further configure these "
"volumes to store data from certain origin servers and/or domains in the "
":file:`hosting.config` file."

"The volume configuration must be the same on all nodes in a cluster. You "
"must stop Traffic Server before you change the cache volume size and "
"protocol assignment. For step-by-step instructions about partitioning the"
" cache, refer to :ref:`partitioning-the-cache`."

"where ``volume_number`` is a number between 1 and 255 (the maximum number"
" of volumes is 255) and ``protocol_type`` is ``http``. Traffic Server "
"supports ``http`` for HTTP volume types; ``volume_size`` is the amount of"
" cache space allocated to the volume. This value can be either a "
"percentage of the total cache space or an absolute value. The absolute "
"value must be a multiple of 128 MB, where 128 MB is the smallest value. "
"If you specify a percentage, then the size is rounded down to the closest"
" multiple of 128 MB."

"Each volume is striped across several disks to achieve parallel I/O. For "
"example: if there are four disks, then a 1-GB volume will have 256 MB on "
"each disk (assuming each disk has enough free space available). If you do"
" not allocate all the disk space in the cache, then the extra disk space "
"is not used. You can use the extra space later to create new volumes "
"without deleting and clearing the existing volumes."
