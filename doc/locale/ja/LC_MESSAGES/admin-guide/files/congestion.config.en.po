"The :file:`congestion.config` file (by default, located in "
"``/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/``) enables you to configure Traffic "
"Server to stop forwarding HTTP requests to origin servers when they "
"become congested, and then send the client a message to retry the "
"congested origin server later. After you modify the "
":file:`congestion.config` file, navigate to the Traffic Server bin "
"directory; then run the :option:`traffic_ctl config reload` command to "
"apply changes. When you apply the changes to a node in a cluster, Traffic"
" Server automatically applies the changes to all other nodes in the "
"cluster. Traffic Server uses the :file:`congestion.config` file only if "
"you enable the :ts:cv:`proxy.config.http.congestion_control.enabled` "
"option."
