"Traffic Server supports some session level protocols in place of, or on "
"top of HTTP. These can be provided by a plugin (see :ref:`new-protocol-"
"plugins`) or be one that is supported directly by Traffic Server. The "
"`SPDY <http://www.chromium.org/spdy>`_ protocol is the only one currently"
" supported, but it is planned to support HTTP 2 when that is finalized."
