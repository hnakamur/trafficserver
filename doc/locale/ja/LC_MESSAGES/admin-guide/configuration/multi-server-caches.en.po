"A Traffic Server cluster consists of multiple Traffic Server nodes. The "
"nodes in a cluster share configuration information and can form a single "
"logical cache. Traffic Server detects the addition and deletion of nodes "
"in the cluster automatically and can detect when a node is unavailable. "
"Traffic Server uses its own protocol for clustering, which is multicast "
"for node location and heartbeat, but unicast for all data exchange within"
" the cluster. Traffic Server has two clustering modes:"

"In management-only clustering mode, Traffic Server cluster nodes share "
"configuration information. You can administer all the nodes at the same "
"time. Traffic Server uses a multicast management protocol to provide a "
"single system image of your Traffic Server cluster. Information about "
"cluster membership, configuration, and exceptions is shared across all "
"nodes, and the :program:`traffic_manager` process automatically "
"propagates configuration changes to all the nodes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../admin-guide/configuration/multi-server-caches.en.rst:57
msgid ""
"In full-clustering mode, as well as sharing configuration information, a "
"Traffic Server cluster distributes its cache across its nodes into a "
"single, virtual object store, rather than replicating the cache node by "
"node. Traffic Server can provide an enormous aggregate cache size and can"
" maximize cache hit rate by storing objects only once across the entire "
"cluster."

#: ../../admin-guide/configuration/multi-server-caches.en.rst:64
msgid ""
"A fully clustered Traffic Server maps objects to specific nodes in the "
"cluster. When a node receives a request, it checks to see if the request "
"is a hit somewhere in the cluster. If the request is a hit on a different"
" node, the node handling the request obtains the object from the hit node"
" and serves it to the client. Traffic Server uses its own communication "
"protocol to obtain an object from sibling cluster nodes."
