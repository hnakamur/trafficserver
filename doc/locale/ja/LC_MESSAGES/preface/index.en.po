"|ATS| is a high-performance web proxy cache that improves network "
"efficiency and performance by caching frequently-accessed information at "
"the edge of the network. This brings content physically closer to end "
"users, while enabling faster delivery and reduced bandwidth use. |TS| is "
"designed to improve content delivery for enterprises, Internet service "
"providers (ISPs), backbone providers, and large intranets by maximizing "
"existing and available bandwidth."
