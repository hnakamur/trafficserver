"A forward proxy can be used as a central tool in your infrastructure to "
"access the web and it may be combined with a cache to lower your overall "
"bandwidth usage. Forward proxies act as a gatekeeper between client "
"browsers on your local network and all (or some, at your configuration's "
"discretion) web sites accessed by those clients. The forward proxy will "
"receive the HTTP requests, perform any filtering or request alteration "
"rules you establish, and when appropriate forward the request on to its "
"destination website. The response will return through your proxy, where it "
"may optionally be cached and/or modified, and then returned to the original "
"client."

"Each client must be configured explicitly to use the forward proxy. Client "

msgid ""
"The use of a transparent proxy is typically done in concert with network "
"routing rules which redirect all outbound HTTP traffic through your proxy. "
"Clients will behave, and form their HTTP requests, as if they are "
"contacting the remote site directly, and will not be aware of the existence "
"of a proxy server in between themselves and the remote servers. HTTP "
"requests will be generated per their usual form, with only paths in the "
"command and a separate Host request header::"

"It's important to note that once your Apache Traffic Server is configured "

"This is generally not desirable, as it will permit anyone to potentially "
