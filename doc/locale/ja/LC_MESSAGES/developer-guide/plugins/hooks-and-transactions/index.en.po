"Hooks are points in Traffic Server transaction processing where plugins "
"can step in and do some work. Registering a plugin function for callback "
"amounts to \"adding\" the function to a hook. You can register your "
"plugin to be called back for every single transaction or only for "
"specific transactions."

"A **transaction** consists of a single HTTP request from a client and the"
" response Traffic Server sends to that client. Thus, a transaction begins"
" when Traffic Server receives a request and ends when Traffic Server "
"sends the response."

"Traffic Server uses **HTTP state machines** to process transactions. The "
"state machines follow a complex set of states involved in sophisticated "
"caching and document retrieval (taking into account, for example, "
"alternate selection, freshness criteria, and hierarchical caching). The "
"Traffic Server API provides hooks to a subset of these states, as "
"illustrated in the :ref:`http-txn-state-diagram` below."

"The two **transform hooks**, ``TS_HTTP_REQUEST_TRANSFORM_HOOK`` and "

" the \"set up transform\" ovals in the :ref:`http-txn-state-diagram` "
