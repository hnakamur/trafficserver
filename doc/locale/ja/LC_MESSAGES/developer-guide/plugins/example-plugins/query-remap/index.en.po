"The Remap plugin provides a more flexible, dynamic way of specifying "
"remap rules. It is not built on top of the Traffic Server APIs and exists"
" solely for the purpose of URL remapping. The remap plugin is not global "
"--it is configured on a per-remap rule basis, which enables you to "
"customize how URLs are redirected based on individual rules in the "
"``remap.config`` file."

"The Traffic Server Remap API enables a plugin to dynamically map a client"
" request to a target URL. Each plugin is associated with one or more "
"remap rules in ``remap.config`` (an \"instance\"). If a request URL "
"matches a remap rule's \"fromURL\", then Traffic Server calls the plugin-"
"defined remap function for that request."
