"The IO buffer data structure is the building block of the vconnection "
"abstraction. An **IO buffer** (``TSIOBuffer``) is composed of a list of "
"buffer blocks that point to buffer data. Both the buffer block "
"(``TSIOBufferBlock``) and buffer data (``TSIOBufferData``) data "
"structures are reference-counted, so they can reside in multiple buffers "
"at the same time. This makes it extremely efficient to copy data from one"
" IO buffer to another via ``TSIOBufferCopy``, since Traffic Server must "
"only copy pointers and adjust reference counts appropriately (and doesn't"
" actually copy any data)."

"The IO buffer abstraction provides for a single writer and multiple "
"readers. In order for the readers to have no knowledge of each other, "
"they manipulate IO buffers through the ``TSIOBufferReader`` data "
"structure. Since only a single writer is allowed, there is no "
"corresponding ``TSIOBufferWriter`` data structure. The writer simply "
"modifies the IO buffer directly. To see an example that illustrates how "
"to use IOBuffers, refer to the sample code in the description of "
":c:func:`TSIOBufferBlockReadStart`."

"The ``TSIOBufferReader`` data structure tracks how much data in "
"``TSIOBuffer`` has been read. It has an offset number of bytes that is "
"the current start point of a particular buffer reader (for every read "
"operation on an ``TSIOBuffer``, you must allocate an "
"``TSIOBufferReader``)."
