"Hooks are points in Apache Traffic Server transaction HTTP processing "
"where plugins can step in and do some work. Registering a plugin function"
" for callback amounts to adding the function to a hook. You can register "
"your plugin to be called back for every single transaction, or for "
"specific transactions only."

"HTTP :term:`transaction` hooks are set on a global basis using the "
"function :func:`TSHttpHookAdd`. This means that the continuation "
"specified as the parameter to :func:`TSHttpHookAdd` is called for every "
"transaction. :func:`TSHttpHookAdd` is typically called from "
":func:`TSPluginInit` or :func:`TSRemapInit`."

":func:`TSHttpSsnHookAdd` adds :arg:`contp` to the end of the list of HTTP"
" :term:`session` hooks specified by :arg:`id`. This means that "
":arg:`contp` is called back for every transaction within the session, at "
"the point specified by the hook ID. Since :arg:`contp` is added to a "
"session, it is not possible to call :func:`TSHttpSsnHookAdd` from the "
"plugin initialization routine; the plugin needs a handle to an HTTP "
"session."
