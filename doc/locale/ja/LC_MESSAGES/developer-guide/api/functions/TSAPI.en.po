"You compile your plugin source code to create a shared library that "
"Traffic Server loads when it is started. Your plugin contains callback "

"The TS prefix is used for all function and variable names defined in the "

"and :func:`TSContCreate`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer-guide/api/functions/TSAPI.en.rst:96

#: ../../developer-guide/api/functions/TSAPI.en.rst:103

#: ../../developer-guide/api/functions/TSAPI.en.rst:109
msgid ""
"Function names use the following subject-verb naming style: "
"TS-<subject>-<verb>, where <subject> goes from general to specific. This "
"makes it easier to determine what a function does by reading its name. "
"For example, the function to retrieve the password field (the specific "

"When Traffic Server is first started, it consults the plugin.config file "
