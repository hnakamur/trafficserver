"This call attempts to create an HTTP state machine and a virtual connection "
"to that state machine. This is more efficient than using :c:func:"

"The SPDY implementation uses this to correlate client sessions with SPDY "

"The :arg:`tag` is selected to be the NPN string for the client session "
"protocol, e.g. \"spdy/3\" or \"spdy/3.1\". Log post processing can then "
"count the number of connections for the various supported protocols and the "
"number of SPDY virtual streams for each real client connection to Traffic "
