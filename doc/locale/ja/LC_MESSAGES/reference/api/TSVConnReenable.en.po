"If the server is running openssl 1.0.1 with the appropraite patch installed "
"or it is running openssl 1.0.2, the plugin writer can pause SSL handshake "
"processing by not reenabling the connection.  Without the openSSL patch or "
"running an openssl version older than 1.0.2, the handshake processing in "
"``SSL_accept`` will not be stopped even if the SNI callback does not "
"reenable the connection."

"Additional processing could reenable the virtual connection causing the "
